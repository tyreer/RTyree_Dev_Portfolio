He's an excellent front-end developer with the ability to code pixel perfect renditions of designs across browsers and devices, as well as solid JavaScript skills. Moreover he's accountable and a strong team player, going beyond the call of duty to help bring in projects on time. He comes highly recommended!</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-o-brien-2b92737/"><p><span class="testimonial-name">Toby O'Brien</span><br/><span class="testimonial-title">Senior project manager<br/>Reading Room</span></p></a><br/><p>I served as graphic designer for the fifth edition of FRONT with Robert acting as co-director of the publication. Working with Rob was one of the best collaborative experiences I've had. He's an excellent leader and author and is incredibly thoughtful, organized and considerate. I'd absolutely recommend him as a colleague or employee.</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-flood-90229726"><p><span class="testimonial-name">Justin Flood</span><br/><span class="testimonial-title">Senior designer and art director<br/>Wieden + Kennedy</span></p></a><br/><p>In the time I've known Robert, I was impressed with his motivation to learn & then apply those skills. He was one of my brightest students to date & was also helpful to his classmates. Following the class, he has been engaged with various open source projects & has shown initiative to contributing code as well as ideas, which I feel is a necessary characteristic for today's developers. I'm happy to recommend Robert for any developer positions & would definitely work with him again in the future.</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidedaniel"><p><span class="testimonial-name">David Daniel</span><br/><span class="testimonial-title">Full stack software engineer<br/>Nike</span></p></a><br/><p>I supervised Robert for two years, and the skill of his I most admire is his versatility. Not only is he an excellent instructor, but he is also talented in design and technology-based projects. One contribution to the organization has been a website that integrates intuitive scheduling features. Robert's work took an outdated paper-based system and converted it to a user-friendly online one. It allows our multi-cultural and multi-lingual student population to easily make tutoring appointments. Always a patient teacher in the classroom, Robert has also demonstrated ease with helping colleagues who might self-describe as digital visitors to easily access appointment information from the website.</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-fulton-52998736"><p><span class="testimonial-name">Erica Fulton</span><br/><span class="testimonial-title">Academic director<br/>Pacific International Academy</span></p></a><br/><p>Robert created a beautiful website for my massage therapy practice. The quality of the website was matched by his extreme professionalism and friendliness. I was impressed with the clarity and organization that he brought to the project. From beginning to end, he communicated clearly and followed through on our agreements. I would gladly recommend Robert to employers who are committed to creating beautiful and high quality products and experiences.</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-gutgsell-2985ba55"><p><span class="testimonial-name">Luke Gutgsell</span><br/><span class="testimonial-title">Licensed massage therapist<br/>Bodywork by Luke</span></p></a></div></div></section><section id="contact"><div class="title-container--contact"><div class="title-container__div--contact"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyreer" target="_blank"><picture><source srcset="5df4fe68391ddac6479bc7067b7f6130.webp, 1fb377d6a8219c6a7561e8c8515b9f96.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img src="a958d9a2f5762d59d9adc40838a63132.jpg" srcset="a958d9a2f5762d59d9adc40838a63132.jpg, 00627f273febdfc4229d65e6266a4385.jpg 2x" alt="Photograph of Robert Tyree" class="profile-image"/></picture></a></div></div><div class="body-text-container"><h2 class="center">contact</h2><div class="contact-icon-container"><a href="https://github.com/tyreer" aria-label="Go to Robert Tyree's GitHub profile"><i class="fa fa-github fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyreer" aria-label="Go to Robert Tyree's LinkedIn profile"><i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> </a><a href="https://www.twitter.com/tyreer" aria-label="Go to Robert Tyree's Twitter profile"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div></div></section><script src="bundle.js?7a1ba0eff8a736c9e1eb"></script></body></html>
