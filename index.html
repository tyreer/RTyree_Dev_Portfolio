          <h1>I'm a frontend developer with a background in the arts and education.</h1>
            <p>Learning frontend essentials, I‚Äôve had to resurrect the gold-star glory of my teenage conquests in calculus while drawing inspiration from the courage and resilience of my university-bound ESL students.</p>
            <p>I find elegance first in essays and poetry, though I‚Äôm starting to see it in arrow functions and spread operators too. I tend to labor lovingly in the service of big ideas, as when my undergrad thesis paired nightclub dancing with Deleuze + Lacan. These days, that same drive is starting to speak in UIs and considered line widths, guided by a clear aesthetic sensibility. My browser voice is finding its legs, and looking for a team to run with.</p>
            <p>New to London from Portland, Oregon, I‚Äôd love to get in touch to discuss new work.</p>

          <p>I served as graphic designer for the fifth edition of FRONT with Robert acting as co-director of the publication. Working with Rob was one of the best collaborative experiences I've had. He's an excellent leader and author and is incredibly thoughtful, organized and considerate. I'd absolutely recommend him as a colleague or employee.</p>

          <br>
          <p>In the time I've known Robert, I was impressed with his motivation to learn & then apply those skills. He was one of my brightest students to date & was also helpful to his classmates. Following the class, he has been engaged with various open source projects & has shown initiative to contributing code as well as ideas, which I feel is a necessary characteristic for today's developers. I'm happy to recommend Robert for any developer positions & would definitely work with him again in the future.</p>

          <br>
          <p>I supervised Robert for two years, and the skill of his I most admire is his versatility. Not only is he an excellent instructor, but he is also talented in design and technology-based projects. One contribution to the organization has been a website that integrates intuitive scheduling features. Robert's work took an outdated paper-based system and converted it to a user-friendly online one. It allows our multi-cultural and multi-lingual student population to easily make tutoring appointments. Always a patient teacher in the classroom, Robert has also demonstrated ease with helping colleagues who might self-describe as digital visitors to easily access appointment information from the website.</p>

          <p>Robert created a beautiful website for my massage therapy practice. The quality of the website was matched by his extreme professionalism and friendliness. I was impressed with the clarity and organization that he brought to the project. From beginning to end, he communicated clearly and followed through on our agreements. I would gladly recommend Robert to employers who are committed to creating beautiful and high quality products and experiences.</p>
