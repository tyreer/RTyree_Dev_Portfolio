## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Incremental Progress**: Each step builds on the previous
2. **Safety First**: Maintain ability to rollback at any point
3. **Test Early**: Verify functionality after each step
4. **No Orphaned Code**: Every change is integrated immediately
5. **Clear Dependencies**: Each step has clear prerequisites

### Step Sizing Criteria
- **Small Enough**: Can be completed in 15-30 minutes
- **Big Enough**: Moves the project forward meaningfully
- **Testable**: Can verify success immediately
- **Reversible**: Can be undone if needed
- **Self-Contained**: Doesn't leave broken state
